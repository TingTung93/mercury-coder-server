# Contributing to Mercury Coder Server

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Mercury Coder Server as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Setting Up Development Environment

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your environment variables
4. Build the project: `npm run build`
5. Run tests: `npm test`

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow the existing code style
- Write meaningful commit messages following conventional commits format
- Keep functions small and focused
- Document complex logic
- Write tests for new functionality
