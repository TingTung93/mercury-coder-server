# Product Context: Mercury Coder Protocol Server

## 1. Problem Space

Developing applications often requires interacting with powerful AI coding assistants. However, directly integrating complex AI models with tool-using capabilities into every application can be inefficient and complex. Managing API keys, handling diverse tool execution environments, and interpreting potentially complex responses from the AI add significant overhead.

There is a need for a standardized, intermediary service that simplifies this interaction. Developers need a way to send a coding task request to a single point and receive the results, without managing the intricacies of the AI API interaction and tool execution directly.

## 2. Vision

To create a streamlined backend service (the MCP Server) that acts as a reliable gateway to advanced AI coding assistants (like Mercury Coder). This server will abstract away the complexity of direct AI API interaction and tool management, providing a simple interface for client applications to leverage powerful coding assistance.

## 3. Goals

- **Simplify Integration:** Provide a straightforward API for client applications to request coding assistance.
- **Enable Tool Usage:** Reliably handle instructions from the AI to use specific tools (like file system access, code execution, web searches) within a controlled environment.
- **Centralize Logic:** Consolidate the logic for communicating with the AI API, interpreting responses, and managing tool execution.
- **Enhance Reliability:** Offer a stable service that client applications can depend on.

## 4. Why Now?

The increasing sophistication of AI coding assistants and their ability to use tools makes direct integration challenging. A dedicated protocol server becomes essential for managing this complexity and making these advanced capabilities accessible in a standardized way.

## 5. Target Users & Needs

- **Application Developers:** Need an easy way to add AI coding features (like code generation, debugging, refactoring with tool support) to their applications without deep AI integration work.
- **Platform Builders:** Require a backend component to power AI coding features within larger development platforms or services.

## 6. Current State

The existing MCP server implementation is not functioning correctly. It fails to reliably process requests, interact with the AI API, or handle tool execution as intended. A significant review and refactoring effort is required to achieve the product vision.
