# Project Brief: Mercury Coder Protocol Server

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the project brief for the Mercury Coder Protocol (MCP) Server. The server acts as a backend intermediary, designed to handle coding assistance requests. It leverages an external API (like Mercury Coder or a similar service) to access advanced AI capabilities, including tool usage, for completing coding tasks.

## 2. Project Goals

- **Primary Goal:** Create a robust and reliable server that can receive coding task requests, interact with an external coding AI API (like Mercury Coder), manage tool execution based on the API's instructions, and return the results to the client.
- **Functionality:** Implement core features for handling requests, API communication, state management (if necessary), tool execution context, and response formatting.
- **Reliability:** Ensure the server is stable, handles errors gracefully, and can manage concurrent requests if required.
- **Maintainability:** Write clean, well-documented, and modular code that is easy to understand and extend.
- **Refactoring:** Address current issues preventing the server from working as intended and refactor the existing codebase for clarity, efficiency, and correctness.

## 3. Scope

**In Scope:**

- Server setup and basic request handling (e.g., via HTTP).
- Communication layer to interact with the external coding AI API.
- Logic to interpret API responses, especially instructions involving tool usage.
- Secure and reliable execution of allowed tools based on API directives.
- Error handling and logging mechanisms.
- Refactoring of the existing codebase to meet the project goals.
- Basic documentation within the Memory Bank.

**Out of Scope:**

- Development of the external coding AI API itself.
- Complex UI/Client-side implementation (focus is on the backend server).
- Advanced security features beyond basic secure tool execution.
- Performance optimization beyond ensuring reasonable responsiveness.

## 4. Target Audience/Users

- Developers or applications requiring coding assistance capabilities via an API.
- Systems integrating AI-powered coding tools.

## 5. Success Metrics

- The server successfully processes coding requests and returns accurate results from the AI API.
- The server correctly interprets and executes tool usage instructions from the API.
- The server operates reliably without frequent crashes or errors.
- The refactored codebase is demonstrably cleaner, more modular, and easier to maintain.
- Key issues identified in the initial review are resolved.
